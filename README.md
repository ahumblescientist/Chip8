## Compiling / Running

1. You need to have [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/FrontPage) installed in order to compile the code
2. mkdir bin (since i made git ignore it)
3. run the command: "make" and you should find a binary file called "main" in the bin dir
4. note that i only tested it for linux, if you are using windows or mac thats a you problem

## Usage

``` 
./bin/main [chip8 file] 
```
where [chip8 file] is the path for the chip8 ROM you want to use
